## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**This project has a knowledge graph. Reach for the code-review-graph MCP tools before
Grep/Glob/Read** — they cost fewer tokens and return structural context (callers, dependents,
test coverage) that file scanning cannot. Start at `semantic_search_nodes_tool`; fall back to
Grep/Glob/Read only where the graph doesn't reach. Each tool's own description covers the rest.
